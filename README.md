[SolanaTools](https://solanatools.vercel.app/) but using [Solana Actions](https://solana.com/docs/advanced/actions).

## Getting Started

Clone the repo, install the dependencies and run the development server.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cryptoloutre/solanatools-actions.git
cd solanatools-actions
npm install
npm run dev
```

Modify the `src/app/api/actions/close-accounts/route.ts` file with our own transaction. Check out [Dialect's documentation](https://dashboard.dialect.to/actions) to know how to build, test and deploy your Action. 

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out their [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
